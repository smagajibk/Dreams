Dreams
======

Dream is what we did when we are sleeping, dream is plan, dream is imagination, dream is expectation, it comes to us as miracle, foreshadow, or when our heart loves or hate something so much, and the last one is that of devil. When the application of your dream comes true you are miraclous one therefore thank your creator.
